We use sterile, painless, buccal swabs that collect epithelial cells from inside the participants cheeks. We can also do the testing with blood, by request. Both blood and buccal swab results are guaranteed. It is legally required that our collectors take a picture of all tested parties at the time of the collection. Clients may also bring in a recent photo of all parties being tested.</div>

						<h3>Results Guaranteed <i class="fa fa-check"></i></h3>
						Our DNA test is the most accurate DNA test available. We will test the child, the alleged father, and, when possible, the mother of the child. Our DNA test results will prove whether the tested man is the father or not. If he is NOT the father, the test results will be able to exclude him and will show a probability of 0%. If he IS the father, the test results will NOT be able to exclude him and will show a probability of at least 99.99%. Our accuracy is significantly higher than most other laboratories and more than 1 million times higher than government standards.
						<p>Our DNA tests are all run twice, following the most strict guidelines, which guarantees conclusive, accurate results. Results will be available within 3 business days from date of collection for our standard DNA test. Our chain of custody for our legal test provides results that can be used in any private or legal situation. Results can be used for changing names on Birth Certificates, obtaining life or health insurance for a child, child support, custody or wills. Test results can be used in any U.S. Court of law.</p>
						<div style="margin-top:20px;font-size:11pt;font-family:'Courier New';"><i class="fa fa-asterisk"></i> In rare cases genetic mutations can be identified. Our lab can not guarantee results >99.99% probability when a genetic mutation occurs. In cases when these rare genetic mutations are identified additional extended testing may be needed to reach the 99.99% probability.</div>

					<div class="faq">
						<div class="num">1.</div>
						<div class="q">Can DNA Testing be done without the mother's sample?</div>
						<div class="a">Yes the testing can be completed without having mom's sample. However about one case out of every 200 will need additional testing or the mother's sample. Therefore it is always recommended to include the mother's samples if possible.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq">
						<div class="num">2.</div>
						<div class="q">How are typical samples collected?</div>
						<div class="a">Most collections are performed with a sterile swab. The swabs are rubbed inside the cheek to collect epithelial cells from all tested individuals. The collection is painless. Samples are collected from one person at a time and sealed in front of the clients.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq">
						<div class="num">3.</div>
						<div class="q">Can blood be used for testing?</div>
						<div class="a">If you do not wish to painlessly have your epithelial cheek cells collected, you may use blood from one or all individuals being tested. Results are guaranteed with either blood or the epithelial cheek cells.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq">
						<div class="num">4.</div>
						<div class="q">How old does the child have to be?</div>
						<div class="a">Testing can be completed on newborns, any age child or adult. We can even do prenatal testing. With prenatal testing there is a increased cost and the mothers Obstetric doctor will have to preform collection of the samples.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq">
						<div class="num">5.</div>
						<div class="q">Can testing be completed if the alleged father is deceased?</div>
						<div class="a">Yes there are several ways to do the testing. Samples can be collected at the time of autopsy like cheek cells, blood or a tissue sample. Other options are if they had recent surgery or blood work at a hospital the next of kin can sign a release of the samples. Or if the grandparents are available, we can do GrandParentage collections.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq">
						<div class="num">6.</div>
						<div class="q">What if the mother and child and the alleged father live in different cities or states?</div>
						<div class="a">Testing can be performed anywhere in the U.S. as well as in different countries. We have collection sites nationwide. Our client will be responsible for one shipping fee and we will cover the other shipping fee if it is in the U.S. As soon as both sets of samples get to our lab testing begins and results are available for release in 2 business days.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq">
						<div class="num">7.</div>
						<div class="q">How long does a standard paternity test take?</div>
						<div class="a">Our tests are available for the alleged father and child or the alleged father, child and mother in 3 business days from the day of collection. Other testing may take additional testing time. Please talk to your case manager with any questions.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq">
						<div class="num">8.</div>
						<div class="q">Do I need a doctor or an attorney to get a legal DNA test?</div>

					</div>
					<div class="faq">
						<div class="num">9.</div>
						<div class="q">Do any insurance companies cover the cost of a paternity test?</div>
						<div class="a">No, DNA testing is not considered a medical necessity. There is no insurance company that will pay for DNA testing.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq">
						<div class="num">10.</div>
						<div class="q">Can payments be made on my bill?</div>
						<div class="a">Payments can be made but we cannot release the results until the final payment is submitted.</div>
